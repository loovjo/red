Usage: red [-d <command>] [-s] [file/--]

A simple line-based file editor

Options:
    -d <command>: Instead of reading commands from STDIN, use these commands instead. Commands are separated by `;`
                  which can be escaped with `\`.

    -s:           Silent mode, makes commands not show any information beyond it's purpose. For example, `s/x/y/` will
                  usually show a message telling you how many replacements were made, but won't with `-s`. Commands like
                  `p` will show output as that is its only purpose. This command is useful in combination with `-d`.
